# Difference Calculator

## Description

Difference Calculator is a program that determines the difference between two data structures. 
This is a popular task for which there are many online services, such as: http://www.jsondiff.com/. 
A similar mechanism is used for test output or for automatically tracking changes in configuration files.

Utility features:

Support for different input formats: YAML and JSON
Report generation in plain text, stylish, and JSON formats

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Gradle are installed on your system.

To obtain the project, clone it from the repository:

_git clone [https://github.com/artemevpaul/java-project-71.git]_


## Compiling and Building the Application

To compile and build the application, navigate to the project directory and use the Gradle task `run` or by using the following command:

_make run

This command compiles the Java source files, builds the project, and runs the application.

## Running the Built Application

If the project has already been built, you can quickly start the application using the following Makefile command:

_make run-dist_

This command is designed for convenience, allowing for rapid launching of the built application without recompiling.
